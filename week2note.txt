Week 2 
Lesson1 Gossip
1.1 multicast problem
tree base multicast protocols:
use either ACKs or NAKs 
(Scalable Reliable Multicast): Use NAKs, add random delays, use exponential backoff to avoid NAK problem
(Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol): ACKs, sent to designated receivers, which retransmit missing multicast 

1.2 gossip protocol
protocol rounds b random targets per round once you are affected,
push gossip: once your receive one,  you start gossiping out
pull gossip: periodically send query to random selected nodes, do you received recent msgs? get the msg 
fast, reliable, fault tolerance, scalable

Lesson2 Membership
2.1 group membership list
list records all the alive processes in the system, a failure detector and a dissemination system with detect and disseminate the failure proces to all the other processes

2.2 failure detectror 
properties: completeness,  accuracy, (impossible in lossy network), speed, scale(equal load)
            guaranteed,    partial guarantee

centralized heartbeating 
ring heartbeating(unpredictable on simultaneous multiple failures)
all to all heartbeating 

2.3 gossip style membership(failure detector)
nodes periodically gossip their membership list 
on receipt, the local membership list is updated to local time 
if the heartbeat has not increased for more than Tfail seconds, the membership is considered failed
after Tcleanup seconds, it will delete the member from the list

2.4 SWIM failure detector
pi send ping to pj 
if not received, select k random process send ping to pj, k random process ping pj and ack to pi
